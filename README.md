### Solution retrospective

This challenge was a great opportunity to refresh my knowledge of Flexbox. I also experimented with the gap property on Flexbox elements to reduce the use of margins and padding. This helped me stay as close as possible to the original design while keeping the code concise.

If I were to take this challenge again, I would like to explore a different approach to responsivenessâ€”for example, using the clamp property on text instead of relying solely on media queries.

I would be grateful for any kind of feedback!
