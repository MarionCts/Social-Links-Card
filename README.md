## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I experimented with the "gap" property on flexbox elements, in order to avoid using too much margins and paddings. This helped me a lot to stay as close as possible to the original design and to keep the code as short as possible.


### Continued development

I want to get more confortable with semantic HTML and CSS transitions.
